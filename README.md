This repository contains a demo PWA chatbot. Open `assistant-ki-app-test.html`
in a modern browser to try it out. You can serve the files with any static
web server, for example:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve .
```

The conversation history is stored locally in the browser and sent to a
Make.com webhook.
